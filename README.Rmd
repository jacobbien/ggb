# ggb

This R package implements the graph-guided banding estimators introduced in
[Bien, J. (2018) "Graph-Guided Banding of the Covariance Matrix"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00451). Journal of the American Statistical Association.

The easiest way to install ggb is by using the [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) R package (if not already installed, open R and type `install.packages("devtools")`). To install ggb, type

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jacobbien/ggb", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
in R.  This installs `ggb` from github and builds its vignette.  To see the vignette (which is the best way to understand how to use `ggb`), type

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette("using_ggb")
```
in R.
